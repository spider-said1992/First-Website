Abraham Lincoln, byname Honest Abe, the Rail-Splitter, 
or the Great Emancipator, (born February 12, 1809, near Hodgenville, 
Kentucky, U.S.—died April 15, 1865, Washington, D.C.), 16th president of the United States
 (1861–65), who preserved the Union during the American Civil War and brought about 
 the emancipation of the slaves.

Among American heroes, Lincoln continues to have a unique appeal for his fellow countrymen 
and also for people of other lands. This charm derives from his remarkable life story—the 
rise from humble origins, the dramatic death—and from his distinctively human and humane 
personality as well as from his historical role as saviour of the Union and emancipator
 of the slaves. His relevance endures and grows especially because of his eloquence as a 
 spokesman for democracy. In his view, the Union was worth saving not only for its own 
 sake but because it embodied an ideal, the ideal of self-government. In recent years, 
 the political side to Lincoln’s character, and his racial views in particular, have 
 come under close scrutiny, as scholars continue to find him a rich subject for research. 
 The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., 
was dedicated to him on May 30, 1922.
